This is a literate programming document detailing my GNU/Linux + Emacs setup. It tangles out to various system configuration files.
A major source for this process is Howard Abrams' [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html][Literate DevOps]] series. Also useful are the source files from his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg&t=143s][video]], found [[https://github.com/howardabrams/literate-devops-demo][here]].

Of note is the ~org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize~ command from =org-plus-contrib=, which allows a buffer or subtree to be automagically turned into an html email and opened ready for sending (comments and all) in mu4e.

In the case of editing external files that might then need to be =detangled=, instead of using the ~org-babel-detangle~ function we use mtkeman's [[https://github.com/mtekman/org-tanglesync.el][org-tanglesync.el]], which allows a more sophisticated detangling process via diffing.
